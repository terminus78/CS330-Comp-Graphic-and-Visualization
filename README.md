**How do I approach designing software?**

> During the course of this project, I've learned the workflow of generating a 3D scene using the OpenGL API. When designing software, I first look at the big picture and begin charting out the way the program will flow. I then break up these diagrams into smaller pieces until I have enough detail to build a functional, robust program. Following this approach helps me to stay organized, on topic, manage scope creep, and build all around better software.

**How do I approach developing programs?**

> I followed an iterative design process. I worked from the outside in, developing the major parts of the program and then honing in on the details until the scene looked right. Working from a large scope first allowed me to make sure that the program was well aligned with the requirements before sharpening the little details.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

> Studying computational graphics has given me an appreciation for how graphics are actually generated behind the scenes. I have a better understanding of the process of rendering and the actual method by which computers convert three dimensional objects into a two dimensional projection on a flat screen. This knowledge will help me to design better software when making visualizations or computer graphics in the future.
